%Observations of low redshift galaxies have established a relationship between galaxy stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR, controversially ref called the "fundamental relation" (Ellison+2008, Mannucci+2010, LaraLopez+2010). At redshifts between 1 and 3, the nature of the FMR is uncertain. Some studies find a constant FMR at all metallicities (Wuyts et al. 2012,Henry et al. 2013; Hunt et al. 2016) while others find a FMR that evolves with redshift (Zahid et al. 2014; Grasshorn Gebhardt et al. 2016; Kashino et al. 2017).
%Our understanding of gas properties in the earliest galaxies remains primitive. This is exacerbated by our lack of tools; at redshifts above $z{\sim}5$, the well-established optical diagnostics are observationally inaccessible with ground-based optical and IR facilities. To probe the physical conditions of the gas in these early galaxies, we must instead rely on emission line diagnostics that originate in the ultra-violet (UV) part of the spectrum.
